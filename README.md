# SQL AUTOINCREMENTING
Databases are known to store a large amount of data in a logical format.Itâ€™s practically impossible to enter the numbers manually. So, instead, we can use Auto Increment in SQL. Auto-increment allows a unique number to be generated automatically when a new record is inserted into a table. Often this is the primary key field that we would like to be created automatically every time a new record is inserted.

To use the auto increment field, in PostgreSQL, we have to create an auto-increment field with the sequence object. The sequence object generates a number sequence.
### Serial datatype is an auto increment datatype in postgresql.
Syntax:

CREATE TABLE TableName (
Column1 DataType  SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
Column2 DataType, 
);
#### FOR EXAMPLE:
Create a table with the name Customers, and columns CustomerID, CustomerName, Age and PhoneNumber. Auto-increment the CustomerID and make it the primary key for the table.

# SUBQUERY Vs JOIN
Both Subqueries and join are used to combine data from different tables into a single result.


|                         SUBQUERY                                      |                       JOIN                          |                                                    
| -------------                                                         |                   -------------                     |
| * It can be used to return either a single value or a row             | * Joins are used to return rows                     |
| * we can select the columns from first table only.                    | * We can select the columns from either of the table|
| * Sometimes Works Slower than joins because of nested queries         | * In general joins work faster than sub-queries.    |
